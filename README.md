# Pico SDK Tools

This repository is used to provide pre-built binaries of the SDK tools for Windows, MacOS, Raspberry Pi OS, and other Linux operating systems (builds performed on Ubuntu).
These binaries are primarilly for use by the [pico-vscode](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-vscode) extension, and the release format is subject to change at any time.

The tools currently included are
* picotool
* OpenOCD
* pioasm
* Risc-V Toolchain for Raspberry Pi OS - for other OSs, the extension uses the compilers from [Core-V](https://www.embecosm.com/resources/tool-chain-downloads/#corev)
